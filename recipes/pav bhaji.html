    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        With the popularity of this recipe, there have been several experiments and variations to the pav bhaji recipe. Today a normal pav-bhaji street food vendor has myriad options to offer. From cheese to paneer and even mushroom-flavored bhaji recipes have surged to the streets. But my personal favorite has always been the simple extra butter-tossed colored pav-bhaji recipe.
